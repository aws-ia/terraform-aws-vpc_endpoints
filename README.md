# Terraform AWS VPC endpoints module

Enables adding AWS VPC endpoints to an existing VPC. 

> Note: This module is in alpha state and is likely to contain bugs and updates may introduce breaking changes. It is not recommended for production use at this time.

The module is generated by a python script that queries AWS api's for available endpoints, their types, and what they support. this module aims to improve over using the aws provider directly in the following ways:

* Declare one resource for as many endpoints as you need, incorporating  gateway and interface endpoints.
* Validation of endpoint names to fail fast when an endpoint is invalid. 
* Documents available endpoints.

TODO:
* support custom PrivateLink endpoints
* support gateway load balancers
* tests
